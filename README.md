## 📌 Background & Overview
The goal of this project is to build an **analytic dashboard** using Power BI.  
Through this project, we will practice:
- Understanding stakeholder reporting needs.  
- Designing dashboard layout, structure, and color themes.  
- Building interactions within reports.  
- Creating structured content with clear messaging.  
- Reviewing and continuously improving dashboards.
  
### 👤 Project Audience
This project is built for:
- **Senior Managers & Business Leaders** who need a clear, data-driven view of business performance to support market expansion and product strategy
- **Data Analysts / Business Analysts** as a demonstration of end-to-end analytical thinking, from business understanding to insight-driven recommendations
- **Recruiters & Hiring Managers** evaluating skills in data modeling, KPI design, Power BI storytelling, and strategic analysis

### 🏢 Business Context and ❓Question 
Superstore is a global retail company operating across multiple markets worldwide. 
As the company experiences rapid growth, senior management requires consolidated insights to answer three critical business questions: 
  1. What is the current overall business performance? 
  2. Which markets should be prioritized for expansion? 
  3. Which product categories and SKUs drive profit — and which erode it? 
This project transforms raw transactional data into a decision-support Power BI dashboard, enabling leadership to shift from high-level reporting to actionable, strategy-focused insights. 

### 🎯Project Outcome:
- **Revenue increased significantly, but profit margins remained broadly flat**, confirming a scale-driven growth pattern rather than efficiency-led improvement. Total revenue reached **$12.64M**, while overall margin held at **11.61%**. In 2014 alone, revenue grew **+26.25% YoY**, but margin declined slightly by **0.23 pp**, indicating rising cost pressure and discount-driven growth.
- the United States continues to dominate total revenue and profit, but **Canada** stands out as as **a high-margin niche market** (~28%) despite modest sales volume, indicating pricing power or lower fulfillment costs.
- **Africa (+23.56% YoY)** and **EMEA (+47.42% YoY)**  recorded the fastest year-over-year growth, highlighting clear expansion potential, although margin volatility suggests the need for tighter cost and logistics control before scaling further.
- New customer acquisition remained structurally weak, with only 15 new customers in 2014 (0.99%). However, **Oceania and Africa attracted a disproportionately higher share of new customers**, while **99.01% of total revenue continued to come from loyal, returning buyers**. Repeat purchase behavior strengthened, with the repeat-customer rate rising from 82.03% (2013) to 87.62% (2014).
- **Technology led both revenue growth and profitability**, generating $4.74M in sales and $663.8K in profit (13.99% margin), accounting for the largest share of total profit. However, return rates in selected technology SKUs—notably printers and advanced equipment—materially diluted margins, as evidenced by loss-making products with margins as low as -80%.
- **Copiers delivered the highest profit per unit**, with margins reaching 17.13% and flagship SKUs such as *Canon imageCLASS 2200* achieving 40.91% margin. Conversely, **low-performing items such as Tables (-8.47% margin)** and specific Furniture and Machinery SKUs destroyed value, collectively dragging Furniture category margin down to 6.94%, less than half that of Technology or Office Supplies.

## 📂 Dataset Description & Data Structure
### 🔍 Data source Overview
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Size**: The Orders table contains 51,290 records.
- **Format**: CSV
  
The analysis is based on three datasets: 

| Dataset | Description                                                  | Records  |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Orders | Contains detailed transaction and customer information        | 51,290  |
| People | Sales representatives by region                               | 13       |
| Returns| Returned order records                                        | 1,100   |

Together, these datasets provide visibility into sales performance, people contribution, and operational risk through returns.

### 🔗 Data Relationships & Model Design
The Power BI data model follows a **fact–dimension structure** to support efficient analysis and reporting.

#### Data Model Structure
- **Orders** → Central **fact table**
- **People** and **Returns** → supporting dimension table 

#### Table Relationships
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17a70658-b5c5-44d1-bd94-d745a4ce61c1)

| From Table | To Table | Join Key  | Relationship Type |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Orders    | People   | Region    | Many-to-One (multiple orders belong to one region) |
| Orders    | Returns  | Order ID  | One-to-One or Left Join (not all orders are returned) |

#### ✅ Analytical Capabilities
This data model enables flexible slicing and filtering across:
- Time
- Market
- Region
- Category
- Product
- Salesperson

#### 🛠️ Workflow
1. Review the project brief and dataset.  
2. Complete the **Empathy** section in the Design Thinking file.

4. Work on **Point of View** and **Ideate**.  
5. Learn about color theory and select a theme.  
6. Build **Version 1** dashboard.  
7. Continuously refine by **switching perspective as a stakeholder**.  
8. Build **Version 2** and validate against Design Thinking iterations.  
9. Finalize **Version 3**.
